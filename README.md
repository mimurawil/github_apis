# github_apis (user search)

A simple UI to demo GitHub search API, mainly focused on user search.

Objectives:

- [x] Search user by text
- [x] Paginated results (navigate through pages, total counts, react with URL changes)
- [x] Display minimum information on the result list (user, description, follower count, profile picture, etc)
- [x] Redirect to user GitHub page when clicking on a result item

## Notes

This small project was made with ReactJS. A few other packages were also installed to help speeding up the process, the most notable worth mentioning is MUI (UI library).

The whole process from start to finish took around 10h (rough count because I forgot to take note).

The search feature can **also** be accessed by just changing the query params in the URL (instead of using the form and the pagination buttons).

The design I chose for this project is very minimalist, and I also added a dark theme mode (top right corner of the page) to make it easier on the eyes :)
